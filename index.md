# FAQs

* * *

## Why did you make this website?

I got frustrated going to each individual school Ph.D. website, navigate to their applicants or FAQs website, then skim for the deadline. This is time-consuming, even at the starting process where an applicant makes a tracking spreadsheet.

There also wasn't any single website that had all the deadlines, so I said screw it and made a Github Pages for that.

## Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. This project is literally a hobby started out of frustration as I was applying myself. When I've time, I will add more schools.

Feel free to tell me the schools and deadlines you want me to add. You can either [post an issue in the repo](https://github.com/PaulTran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues) or [shoot me an email](mailto:gwong.lee@gmail.com).

## How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each school's Ph.D. websites. Maybe later in the future I will.

## Are spring semester deadlines included?

Smart question. Currently, no. Only autumn semester deadlines are collected. I will add spring semester deadlines (if applicable) in the future.

## Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline, with the year being a variable that constantly changes (and would be extra work for me) and isn't as important.

## Will you add more fields in the future?

Maybe, though probably not. That's a lot of work for a one-man hobby.
