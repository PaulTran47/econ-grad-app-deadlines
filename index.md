# FAQs

## Why did you make this website?

Because of perhaps the most mundane first-world problem: I got tired of searching and navigating through each schools' Ph.D. website to skim for the deadline.

There also wasn't any single website that had all the deadlines, so I said screw it and made a GitHub Pages for that.

## What deadlines included?

Only Economics Ph.D. funded deadlines for autumn semester are currently shown. I might show non-funded and spring deadlines in the future.

## Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. This project is literally a hobby started out of frustration as I was applying myself. When I've time, I will add more schools. You can check the changelog on the GitHub repo page.

Feel free to tell me the schools and deadlines you want me to add. You can either [submit an issue](https://github.com/PaulTran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues) or [shoot me an email](mailto:gwong.lee@gmail.com).

## How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each school's Ph.D. websites. Maybe later in the future I will.

## Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline, with the year being a variable that constantly changes (and would be extra work for me) and isn't as important.

## Will you add more fields in the future?

No. A lot of work for a one-man hobby.
