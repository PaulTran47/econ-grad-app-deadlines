# FAQs

[Go up to the top of the table](#this-table-currently-shows-157-schools)

## How do I read the table?

Economics Master's + PhD funded programmes are predominantly shown (US programmes
are virtually all Master's + PhD structured).

If a programme is PhD only (i.e., requires holding a Master's degree for admission),
I will explicitly state as such, in parentheses, next to the school name.

Programmes with no information stated can be assumed to provide a Master's + PhD
structure (regardless of location). At the moment, I am following this structure
for US programmes. To be better safe than sorry, I am specifying Master's + PhD
structure for non-US programmes.

Application deadlines listed are chosen because the corresponding programmes
consider them to be the latest possible date eligible for PhD funding.

**I recommend looking into the programme website in order to confirm if the PhD
starts in the fall or spring semester since this information is not included in
the table for conciseness sake**.

I **WILL NOT** show unfunded PhD deadlines because I believe they are massive
opportunity costs that are worth neither the time nor the effort.

## Who are you?

I'm an economics PhD candidate at [UT Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/gradstudents/plt377)
studying applications of text analysis and natural language processing in
macroeconomics, particularly in central bank communication and expectations formation.
I'm also a USAPL powerlifter (519kg total club ٩( ᐛ )و). If you want to find out
more about me and my research, please visit my [personal website](https://paulletran.com).
You can also find my research on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0zKxrWgAAAAJ),
[my SSRN profile](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7065188),
[my GitHub profile](https://github.com/PaulTran47), and my ORCID (0009-0000-8559-7915).

## Why did you make this website?

Because most schools' PhD websites are awful at clearly displaying the
application deadlines.

There also wasn't any single website that had all the deadlines, so I made this
GitHub Page to track and display this information front and centre for myself
and future applicants.

## Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. Whilst this is a personal project, I have full intention of making this
website contains the deadlines of hundreds of PhD programmes eventually.

You can check the changelog on the GitHub repo page.

If you don't see a particular economics PhD programme, please
[submit an issue to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/PaulTran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues)
or [shoot me an email](mailto:pltran@utexas.edu) with the school's PhD programme
website URL, country, and application deadline.

## Will you be adding Master's only programmes?

Maybe. However, the priority will always be Master's + PhD or PhD only programmes.

## How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each
school's PhD websites.

## Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline. If one needs to
know the year for absolute certainty (e.g., January deadlines), the programme
website is provided.
