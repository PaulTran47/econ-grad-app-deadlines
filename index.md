# FAQs

## How do I read the table?

Economics Master's + PhD funded programmes are predominantly shown (USA programmes are virtually all Master's + PhD structured).

If a programme is PhD only (i.e., requires holding a Master's degree for admission), I will explicitly state as such, in parentheses, next to the school name.

Programmes with no information stated can be assumed to provide a Master's + PhD structure (regardless of location). At the moment, I am following this structure for USA programmes. To be better safe than sorry, I am specifying Master's + PhD structure for non-USA programmes.

I **WILL NOT** show unfunded PhD deadlines because I believe they are massive opportunity costs that are worth neither the time nor the effort.

## Who are you?

I'm an economics PhD candidate at [UT Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/gradstudents/plt377) studying applications of text analysis and natural language processing in macroeconomics, particularly in central bank communication and expectations formation. I'm also a USAPL powerlifter (519kg total club ٩( ᐛ )و). If you want to find out more about me and my research, please visit my [personal website](https://paulletran.com). You can also find my research on [my SSRN profile](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7065188), [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/PaulTran47), and my ORCID (0009-0000-8559-7915).

## Why did you make this website?

Because of perhaps the most mundane first-world problem: I got tired of searching and navigating through each schools' PhD website individually to skim for the application deadlines.

There also wasn't any single website that had all the deadlines, so I made a GitHub Pages to track and display this information front and centre for myself and future applicants.

## Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. Whilst this is a personal project, I have full intention of making this website contains the deadlines of hundreds of PhD programmes eventually.

You can check the changelog on the GitHub repo page.

Also, feel free to tell me the schools and deadlines you want me to add. You can either [submit an issue](https://github.com/PaulTran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues) or [shoot me an email](mailto:pltran@utexas.edu).

## Will you be adding Master's only programmes?

Eventually, yes. The priority will always be Master's + PhD or PhD only programmes, though.

## How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each school's PhD websites.

## Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline. If one needs to know the year for absolute certainty (e.g., for deadlines that are in January), the programme website is provided.
