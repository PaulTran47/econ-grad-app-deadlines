# FAQs

## How do I read the table?

Economics Master's + PhD funded programmes are predominantly shown (USA programmes are virtually all Master's + PhD structured).

If a programme is PhD only (i.e., requires holding a Master's degree for admission), I will explicitly state as such, in parentheses, next to the school name.

Programmes with no information stated can be assumed to provide a Master's + PhD structure (regardless of location).

I **WILL NOT** show unfunded PhD deadlines because I believe they are massive opportunity costs that are worth neither the time nor the effort.

## Who are you?

I'm a fourth-year economics PhD student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/gradstudents/plt377). I'm also a USAPL powerlifter (510kg total club ٩( ᐛ )و). If you want to find out more about me, here's my [personal website](https://paulletran.com).

## Why did you make this website?

Because of perhaps the most mundane first-world problem: I got tired of searching and navigating through each schools' PhD website individually to skim for the deadline.

There also wasn't any single website that had all the deadlines, so I said screw it and made a GitHub Page for that.

## Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. Whilst this is a personal project, I have full intention of making this website contains the deadlines of hundreds of PhD programmes eventually.

You can check the changelog on the GitHub repo page.

Also, feel free to tell me the schools and deadlines you want me to add. You can either [submit an issue](https://github.com/PaulTran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues) or [shoot me an email](mailto:gwong.lee@gmail.com).

## How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each school's PhD websites.

## Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline. If one needs to know the year for absolute certainty (e.g., for deadlines that are in January), the programme website is provided.
