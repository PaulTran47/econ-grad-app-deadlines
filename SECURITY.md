## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although I created this page of my website using GitHub Pages with the full
intention of securing both my and visitors' personal data (i.e., through both
the source code and usage of Cloudflare resources), there is always the
possibility that I have made coding mistakes somewhere along the way that causes
my website to disclose vulnerabilities (e.g., through the Ruby configuration).

In the event that a vulnerability/error/mistake has been discovered about my
website, please [submit an issue to the GitHub repo](https://github.com/paultran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues).
I will then address the problem as soon as possible.
