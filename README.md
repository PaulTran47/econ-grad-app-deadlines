## FAQs
### Who are you?

I'm an economics PhD student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/economics/phd/profile.php?id=plt377). I'm also a USAPL powerliter (504kg total club ٩( ᐛ )و ). My personal website can be found [here](https://paulletran.com) if you want to find out more about me.

### Why did you make this website?

Because of perhaps the most mundane first-world problem: I got tired of searching and navigating through each schools' PhD website individually to skim for the deadline.

There also wasn't any single website that had all the deadlines, so I said screw it and made a GitHub Pages for that.

### What deadlines are included?

Economics PhD (Master's + PhD for non-USA schools) funded deadlines are predominantly shown. Deadlines for autumn start dates are prioritised. I have also included some Master's deadlines if it's indicated that they have a track into the school's PhD programme. I might show non-funded deadlines in the future.

### Are you going to be adding more schools?

Slowly. Whilst this is a personal project, I have full intention of making this website contains the deadlines of hundreds of PhD programmes eventually.

You can check the changelog on the GitHub repo page.

Also, feel free to tell me the schools and deadlines you want me to add. You can either [submit an issue](https://github.com/PaulTran47/econ-grad-app-deadlines/issues) or [shoot me an email](mailto:gwong.lee@gmail.com).

### How is the information updated?

Manually, because I haven't bothered to make it more automated by scrapping each school's PhD websites. Maybe later in the future I will.

### Why isn't the year included?

The day and month are the most important parts of the deadline. If one needs to know the year for absolute certainty (e.g., for deadlines that are in January), the programme website is provided.
